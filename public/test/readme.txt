There are three tasks, please record how long each task takes.

Task A. (took 45min)

Given an unordered CSV list of  positive and negative integers, find the lowest positive number that is missing from the list.


e.g.
 Input:  2, 3, 7, 6, 8, -1, -10, 15
 Output: 1

 Input:   2, 3, -7, 6, 8, 1, -10, 15
 Output: 4

 Input: 1, 1, 0, -1, -2
 Output: 2

Add code to LowestNumberFinder to achieve this.


Task B. (took 22min)

Code exists to add and remove items from a linked list. When index.php is run the code should output something similar to:

List Forwards:  Adama Roslin Baltar Valerii Thrace Tigh
List Backwards:  Tigh Thrace Valerii Baltar Roslin Adama
Item deleted
List Forwards:  Adama Roslin Baltar Thrace Tigh
List Backwards:  Tigh Thrace Baltar Roslin Adama

However the programmer has made a few minor mistakes in either the  ListNode or LinkedList classes. Fix the code so it works.



Task C. (took 1h 15min)

You have been provided in index.php with a variable $data which is an array of data that has the number of messages, source type and destination type.
Add code in index.php to display the information in a table that has row titles containing the source types and column titles containing the destination types. Add row and column totals.
